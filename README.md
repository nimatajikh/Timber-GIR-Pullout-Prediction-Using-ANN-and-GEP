# Timber-GIR-Pullout-Prediction-Using-ANN-and-GEP

This repository contains the source code, dataset, and simulation results used in the study: “Prediction of pull-out behavior of timber glued-in glass fiber reinforced polymer and steel rods under various environmental conditions based on ANN and GEP models.”

# **Overview**

Timber structures increasingly utilize glued-in rod (GIR) systems for their strength and durability. However, predicting their mechanical performance—especially under aggressive environmental exposure such as seawater immersion—remains a challenge. This study applies artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) to predict:

Pull-out load (ultimate resistance)

Free-end slip

of GFRP- and steel-rod timber GIR joints, accounting for both normal and harsh environmental conditions.
